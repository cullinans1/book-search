  ## Description
  
  This project is a MERN project that uses react to create the front end pages, MongoDB, Express, and Node to make the backend of the webpage. It uses a Google API book search to display all of the books after searched. A user will type in a genre, author, title, or anything related to the book they want to search and the books related will show on page. A user can also create an account or login and save books to their account. They will be able to access their saved list of books and be able to delete books.
