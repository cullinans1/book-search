  ## Description
  
  This is a back-end NoSQL project that utilizes MongoDB and Mongoose to run a social media application. It is designed this way to have less structure and allow for a quicker MVP set up as well as hanlding large amounts of unstructured data. Through the routes the CRUD is available for each route of user, users making a thought, and reactions to those thoughts. There is also the ability to add another user as a friend and remove them.
